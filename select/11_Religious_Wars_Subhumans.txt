Do you believe in the afterlife
Termination with a rusty knife
Religious wars no reason why
What a glorious way to die
In the name of God they left you to die
Religious wars there's no reason why
They left you to die
The ultimate excuse is here
Die for a cause, religion is fear
Fear of the threat of something unreal
Abdicate the way you really feel
In the darkness of death
There's no light in your eyes
A cross in your grave
Your time has arrived
