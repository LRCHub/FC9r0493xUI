Away from the night, I walked you through heaven, and
I saw your preacher outside, disguised as another man.
The beast lives on; the beast lives on in a way.
The beast lives on; the beast lives on in my ways.
A-wo-a-wo-a-woah
We sat around; I thought I could do it.
Threw my shit in a bag, and I bounced right through it.
I saw your preacher over there, and my mind started chucklin'.
Your sister said to me, she said, "I'm already taken."
