Because you're there when I awake
And then you give me a life so great
Because the children with you can play
I think, I think I am

'Cause when I speak, you're always there
People listen, what I can tell
Because you're my gospel, my daily bread
That's why I think I am

I am, I am
I think I am
I thank I am
I'm proud I am
A real religious man

I am, I am
I pray I am,
I feel I am
Oh Lord I am
God knows I am
A real religious man

As I realised you're my best friend
Can separate a chance from fate
Because you have all I need to take
That's why I think I am, I am, I am, (oohh)

The silent prayer, I just behave
'Cause saints and sinners aren't quite the same
'Cause it's my temple, the whole wide world
That's why I think I am, I am

I am, I am
I am, I am
I think I am
I'm glad I am
I'm proud I am
A real religious man

I am, I am
I am, I am
I pray I am,
I feel I am
Oh Lord I am
God knows I am
A real religious man

I am, I am
I am, I am
I pray I am
I feel I am,
Oh Lord I am
God knows I am
A real religious man
A real religious man
A real religious man
